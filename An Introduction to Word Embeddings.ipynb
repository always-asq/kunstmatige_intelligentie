    "Many people would say the breakthrough of deep learning in Natural Language Processing started with the introduction of word embeddings. Rather than using the words themselves as features, neural network methods typically take as input dense, relatively low-dimensional vectors that model the meaning and usage of a word. Word embeddings were first popularized through the [Word2Vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781) model, developed by Thomas Mikolov and colleagues at Google. Since then, scores of alternative approaches have been developed, such as [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and [FastText](https://fasttext.cc/) embeddings. In this notebook, we'll explore word embeddings with the original Word2Vec approach, as implemented in the [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) library. "
